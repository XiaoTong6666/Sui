 * @class MountArgvFossil
 * @brief A professional, safe toolkit to find, parse, and sanitize a fossilized mount command's
 argument vector.
 *
 * --- Safety and Ownership ---
 *
 * This class is an "owning" object. Upon construction, it performs a deep copy of all
 * string data from either a raw memory block or a MountInfoEntry into its own std::string members.
 * This makes it completely independent of the original stack memory, ensuring it is safe to hold
 * and use even if the underlying memory is modified or overwritten. This is critical for
 * performing memory sanitization operations.
 *
 * --- The `argv` Fossil Theory ---
 *
 * This class is based on the discovery that the Android 'init' process leaves a leftover
 * data artifact on its stack after performing mount operations before starting Zygote. This
 * artifact is the in-memory representation of the argument vector (argv) for that mount command.
 * The structure is a series of juxtaposed, null-terminated C-strings because they originate
 * from a single buffer that was tokenized in-place. When init calls fork() to start
 * Zygote, Zygote inherits a copy of this "dirty" stack.
